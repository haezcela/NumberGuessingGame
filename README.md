**About This Repository**

This repository is part of my daily challenge to complete projects from roadmap.sh as a refresher to strengthen my coding skills. Each day, I aim to finish a small project to reinforce key programming concepts and improve problem-solving abilities.

Project: CLI-Based Number Guessing Game
https://github.com/haezcela/NumberGuessingGame

**How It Works**

This is a simple command-line game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game includes three difficulty levels that determine the number of attempts allowed.

**Features**

The game starts with a welcome message and rules.

The user selects a difficulty level:

Easy (10 attempts)

Medium (7 attempts)

Hard (5 attempts)

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The user enters guesses, and the game provides feedback:

If the guess is too high or too low.

If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the user and displays the number of attempts.

If the user runs out of attempts, the correct number is revealed.

Input validation ensures the user enters valid numbers.

**How to Run**

Compile the Java program:

javac Main.java

Run the game:

java Main

Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

**Why I'm Doing This**

Following the roadmap helps me stay consistent with coding practice, refresh fundamental concepts, and build small yet meaningful projects. This hands-on approach improves problem-solving skills and reinforces learning.
